# Internship-CNRS-ESPCI
the goal of this project is to analyse the behavior of three mice placed together in a cage, that are being filmed and tracked constantly with Live Mouse Tracker. 
We measured differents parameters, the number of times that a mouse presses a lever, that delivers a pelet of food at a different location, (named Lever), the number of times a mouse goes to look for food at the feeder, (named Beam), and that is measured by the number of times a beam is broken in the feeder, and lastly the number of complete sequences, which is when the same mouse takes less than 6 seconds to go to the feeder after pressing the lever.
We established with these measures several profiles among the mice, and analysed other parameters such as the number of stolen pelets, the position of the mouse when the other the lever is pressed, or where the mice come from when they visit the feeder etc, to try to collect other information.

The R scripts are analysis and statistical tests to try to find correlation and schemes, and make different graphs.
